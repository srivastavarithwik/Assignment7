# Simple Stopwatch Web Application

This simple web application consists of a stopwatch and a date picker. It demonstrates various HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features. Additionally, it utilizes asynchronous programming with Async, Await, Promises, Set Interval, and Clear Interval.

## HTML

The HTML code in `index.html` includes:

- The use of `<!DOCTYPE html` for specifying the document type.
- Meta tags for character set and viewport configuration.
- The `<link>` element to import an external CSS file.
- A container with various elements, including labels, buttons, and an input field.

## CSS

The CSS code in `styles.css` showcases:

- The use of CSS variables (custom properties) declared in `:root`.
- Styling of the entire page, setting background color and font family.
- Centered alignment of content using `text-align` and `display: flex`.
- Use of classes to style different sections, such as `.watch`, `.time`, `.datetime`, and `.controls`.
- Custom styling for buttons, including hover and active states.

## JavaScript

The JavaScript code in `script.js` demonstrates the following features:

- Accessing HTML elements with `document.getElementById`.
- Use of variables, including `timerLabel`, `startButton`, `stopButton`, `resetButton`, and `datePicker`.
- Asynchronous functions (`async function`) using Async and Await:
  - `updateTimer()` to update the timer display.
  - `startTimer()` for starting the stopwatch, using `setInterval`.
- Promises are used within the `updateTimer()` function to perform asynchronous tasks.
- `setInterval` to update the timer display at regular intervals.
- `clearInterval` to stop the timer when needed.
- Functions for starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch.
- Setting the initial date in the date picker and making it non-editable.

The code prevents users from manually typing or editing the date in the input field. Users can select dates from the drop-down calendar while preventing direct keyboard input.

This web application allows users to interact with a stopwatch and select dates using the date picker while showcasing a range of web development features and practices.
